## Covers
- basic input from command line

## Take aways
- mod lets us use functions from other files, as long as its "pub fn"
- variables are static by default, if we know they're going to change we must use the "mut" keyword when declaring
- when adjusting/using variables, we are usually borrowing the variable using "&". If we know we're going to change it, we use "&mut".
